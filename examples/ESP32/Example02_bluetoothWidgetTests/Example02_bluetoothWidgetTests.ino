/*
 * retroTerm Bluetooth widget test sketch
 * 
 * This sketch offers a Classic Bluetooth Serial connection (not BLE) and tests all the widget types, one at a time.
 * 
 * The code for each type of widget is in a separate sketch tab.
 * 
 * Probing terminal size, to see what space is available. You can change terminal size between tests to check this works.
 * Button test. The buttons of different style appear and and can be clicked with mouse or keyboard shortcut.
 * Checkbox test. Three differet checkboxes appear and can be checked with the mouse or keyboard shortcut.
 * Radio button test. Three different radio buttons can be appear and one can be selected with the mouse or keyboard shortcut.
 * Fixed text display test. Three windows of wordwrapped text, they can be clicked on and will scroll with the mouse wheel or arrow keys on the keyboard.
 * Scrolling text display test. Three windows of text, which scroll up as more is added.
 * List box test. Three list boxes with different options that can be selected in each.
 * Text input field test. Three text input fields, which can be selected with the mouse or keyboard shortcuts. You can type in these with normal editing keys.

const char textToShow[] PROGMEM = {"HAMLET: To be, or not to be--that is the question: \
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer \
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune \
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles \
And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep-- \
No more--and by a sleep to say we end \
The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks \
That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation \
Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep \
No more--and by a sleep to say we end \
The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks \
That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation \
Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep-- \
To sleep--perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub, \
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come \
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, \
Must give us pause. There's the respect \
That makes calamity of so long life. \
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, \
Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely \
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay, \
The insolence of office, and the spurns \
That patient merit of th' unworthy takes, \
When he himself might his quietus make \
With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear, \
To grunt and sweat under a weary life, \
But that the dread of something after death, \
The undiscovered country, from whose bourn \
No traveller returns, puzzles the will, \
And makes us rather bear those ills we have \
Than fly to others that we know not of? \
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all, \
And thus the native hue of resolution \
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, \
And enterprise of great pitch and moment \
With this regard their currents turn awry \
And lose the name of action. -- Soft you now, \
The fair Ophelia! -- Nymph, in thy orisons \
Be all my sins remembered."};
